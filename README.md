# Tiger-Shark
### A deep-reinforcement-learning algorithm based toward learning to play [Dolphin Emulator](https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin).
![Showcase Image](github/showcase.md)
## Features
Timelapse proof of model coming soon in YouTube format.
- Learnt model's save locally to computer
- Adjustable time steps
- Adjustable buffer size
- Key action map coupled with duration map for dynamic key-strokes
- Machine fed optimized images post-processing for performance

## Installation and Running
### Installation on Windows 10/11 using release package
1. Install `Python 3.12.2` or supported
2. Download `TigetShark.zip` from v0.1 and extract its contents.
3. Download dependancies
4. Resize dolphin emulator window
5. Run `model.py`

### Automatic Installation on Windows
1. Install `Python 3.12.2` or supported
2. Install `git`
3. Download TigerShark via running `git clone https://github.com/torkay/TigerShark`
4. Download dependancies
5. In the terminal conduct `python Model.py` or Run `model.py`

### ToDo
- Write requirements list for express dependancy install
- Run various emulator clients in parrarel for accelerated learning
- Test by training higher buffer and time steps (Hardware upgrade needed)
- Open action-map scale presets toward other emulator discs

Project is a work-in-progress and may ensue bugs.
- `v0.1 Tested`
